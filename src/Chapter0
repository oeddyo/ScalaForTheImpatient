Most programming technologies are better learned with various web resources rather than a paper book; this is a case where a book is much more appropriate. The complexity of the material is suited to a full written explanation rather than merely a web search and the volume of concepts and features in the Scala language and library easily justifies the length of this book without any padding.

So far, every chapter is genuinely useful. I can feel actual learning benefit from everything covered. Nothing is annoyingly basic: this book assumes you are comfortable with Java or C# and know all about classes/interfaces/inheritance/exceptions/packages/static/scoping/etc. This book is also actually entertaining. This is partly because Scala is so well designed. Once I get an understanding of a new Scala feature and I can see why it's an improvement and it is genuinely fun. But this book does a great job of organizing the material and walking the reader through everything.

I have written a few personal projects in Scala before reading this book, but this book has been excellent at helping me learn the Scala language/library feature set properly rather than just using it as a Java++.

I'd absolutely recommend this to anyone interested in Scala or any Java/C# developer who wants to keep up with the newer developments of the software field.
